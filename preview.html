10. Data Structures

FORMAT: 1A

# Data Structures API
Following [Advanced Attributes](09.%20Advanced%20Attributes.md), this example
demonstrates defining arbitrary data structure to be reused by various
attribute descriptions.

Since a portion of the &#96;Coupon&#96; data structure is shared between the &#96;Coupon&#96;
definition itself and the &#96;Create a Coupon&#96; action, it was separated into a
&#96;Coupon Base&#96; data structure in the &#96;Data Structures&#96; API Blueprint Section.
Doing so enables us to reuse it as a base-type of other attribute definitions.
